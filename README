README FILE

I will be submitting this file, Makefile, Calc.java, and CalcTest.java.

README: provides the grader with background information about my assignment.
Makefile: default target that builds Calc.class and a phony target "test" that builds and runs all unit tests.
Calc.java: is a basic calculator program that can push, pop, peek, reciprocates, add, subtract, multiple, and divide a stack.
CalcTest.java: unit tests for all functions in Calc.java
